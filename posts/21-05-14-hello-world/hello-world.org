* Hello world

I've been fortunate to have more time on my hands lately than in the previous years, so I decided to get back to blogging.

My areas of interests are programming, spirituality and life in general. I'm interested in living a simple and fulfilling life rather than to concentrate on maximal earning.

In fact I live happilly with $75 a week (after rent) in Mexico and I have plenty of time to simply enjoy life.

Thanks for visiting my blog!
