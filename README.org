* About

My blog posts written in the [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]].

* Rationale

I use Org mode for all my writting, hence it only makes sense to use it for my blog as well.

Org mode already supports metadata, which allows for defining *tags*, *draft* status and the like.

* Format

Each blog post has its own directory =YY-MM-DD-slug=. The main file will be simply named =slug.org=, where =slug= matches the slug used in the directory name. The =.profile.zsh= file has =mkpost= function to automate that, just give call it with the slug and it will create the directory structure for you.

Any optional assets will be in the =assets= subdirectory.

* Output

The output is a bunch of JSON files, which are easy for the frontend to consume. Wherever formatting is required, the Org mode format is used on the export side as well.

* Tasks
** TODO Check whether there's a good Org mode parser in either Elm or JS

[[http://mooz.github.io/org-js/#header-3-1-4-3][org-js]] looks promising, I should be able to integrate it using [[https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/custom_elements.html][custom elements]] on the Elm side. In the worst case I can write my own library using PEG.js. There is no PEG in the Elm landscape as far as I know, so that'd probably be the best option.
